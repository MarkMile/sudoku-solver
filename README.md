🧩 Sudoku Solver (Pygame)

A visual Sudoku solver built using Python and Pygame, demonstrating both backtracking algorithms and an interactive GUI. 

Users can input their own Sudoku puzzles or generate one, visualize the solving process step-by-step, and see how the algorithm efficiently fills in each cell.

🚀 Features
    🎮 Interactive GUI – built with Pygame for smooth visualization.
    🧠 Backtracking Algorithm – demonstrates constraint-based recursive solving.
    ✏️ Manual Input Mode – allows users to fill in their own Sudoku puzzle.
    👀 Step-by-Step Visualization – see how the solver explores possible solutions.
    💡 Error Checking – prevents invalid numbers according to Sudoku rules.
    🔁 Reset & Clear Options – start fresh or test multiple puzzles.

🧩 How It Works
    - This program uses a backtracking algorithm, a depth-first search technique that:
    - Finds an empty cell.
    - Tries numbers 1 through 9.
    - Checks if the number placement is valid.
    - Recursively proceeds until the puzzle is solved or backtracks when stuck.

🖥️ Technologies Used
    - Python 3.x
    - Pygame for the graphical interface
    - Backtracking algorithm for solving logic
